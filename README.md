Personal Web Server Made in RUST 

Built using information learned from "RUST Programming Lanugage Book" and using RUST docs

Have a website in which people can create an account to register with the server, or is automatically prompted with a password entering to sign-in. 

New Users can either be SUBSCRIBERS, or PUBLISHERS

Publishers: Can publish new data to the server 
Subscribers: Can subscribe to different news topics to be updated about, receives new publishings over time. Can also unsubscribe from topics to not see them anymore

Server-side: 
Keeps track of user data including names, passwords, subscribers vs publishers, Subscribed/Publisher topics 

Maybe Additions:
- Scrape real news data (would be actually usefull) 
- Tracks number of subscribers for each TOPIC 
- could serve data dynamically as a web page 


OR have clients send data and server processes it to do something with that data
